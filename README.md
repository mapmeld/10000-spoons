## 10,000 Spoons

A <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014">NaNoGenMo-2014</a> entry.

A novel put together programmatically, with the following structure:

* ```All you need is a knife.```

* Sentences scraped from the internet and public domain books, with ```(need(s)|get(s)) a knife (to|for) _```, for at least 39,994 words.

* 10,000 ```spoon```s.

## Inspiration

I saw that one of the first NaNoGenMo novels was 50,000 meows, which made me
think of "10,000 spoons" from "Ironic", and then I needed to fill the other
40,000 words. I decided that computers wouldn't know enough reasons why people
need knives, so it should extract it from Google.

The result speaks for itself.
